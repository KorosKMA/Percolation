# Percolation
A grid of 'N*N' open or filled blocks percolates, if starting from the top of the grid there is an open path to its bottom.

Assuming that any given block in the grid is open with a probability 'p', 
there exists such value of 'p' that for any smaller value the grid will almost certainly not percolate, 
and for any larger value it will almost certainly percolate.

Given the size of the grid 'N', this code will run 'T' tests to find said value of 'p'
